# Long_Squeeze_in_Commodity_Futures_Market

Why do negative prices occur in commodity markets? 
For example, natural gas in Permian Basin, West Texas in 2019 and wholesale electricity in Ontario in 2009 and in Germany in 2017. 
More recently, on April 20, 2020, the May 2020 West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures contract settled at an unprecedented negative price of -$37.63 per barrel, with an intraday trading low of -$40.32 per barrel.

This phenomenon prompted an investigation into futures market manipulation using a two-period batch-trading model with asymmetric information.
Building upon the model of Kyle (1984), we incorporate logistics and storage to accommodate occasional futures price crashes observed in commodity markets. Our model shows that a manipulator who privately knows uninformed trading activity can profit by manipulating the futures market and stockpiling a significant amount of the commodity at the delivery location to create a long squeeze. We find a symmetric pattern between the long squeeze in our study and the short squeeze discussed in Kyle (1984); in both works, an increase in the range of uninformed trading activity leads to a shift in equilibrium from separating to pooling. Additionally, we examine the local relationship be- tween the random storage supply and the pooling equilibrium. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of the dynamics of commodity markets and others potential solutions to prevent long squeezes.
