# Long_Squeeze_in_Commodity_Futures_Market

Why do negative prices occur in commodity markets? 
For example, natural gas in Permian Basin, West Texas in 2019 and wholesale electricity in Ontario in 2009 and in Germany in 2017. 
More recently, on April 20, 2020, the May 2020 West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures contract settled at an unprecedented negative price of -$37.63 per barrel, with an intraday trading low of -$40.32 per barrel.

This phenomenon prompted an investigation into futures market manipulation using a two-period batch-trading model with asymmetric information.
Expanding upon Kyle's model (1984), our research incorporates logistics and storage considerations to explain occasional futures price crashes observed in commodity markets. 
Our model demonstrates that a manipulator with private knowledge of uninformed trading activity can profit by manipulating the futures market and accumulating a significant amount of the commodity at the delivery location, thus creating a long squeeze. 
We discover a symmetrical pattern between the long squeeze in our study and the short squeeze discussed in Kyle's work (1984). 
In both cases, an increase in the extent of uninformed trading activity leads to a shift in equilibrium from separating to pooling.
Furthermore, we explore the localized relationship between random storage supply and the pooling equilibrium. 
By shedding light on the dynamics of commodity markets, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of these markets and presents potential solutions to prevent long squeezes.
